The disintegration of the democracies of Europe has been halted. Free peoples in many parts of the world have been given new hope and new confidence.

There are voices which claim that because our policy has been successful so far, we can afford to relax now. There are some who want to slash the aid we are giving to the economic recovery of other nations; there are some who want to reject the measures that are necessary for defense against aggression; there are some who wish to abandon our efforts toward the revival of world trade. These are the same voices that misled us in the 1920's. They are misguided by short-run considerations. They refuse to face the plain facts.

Yet, so long as there is a threat to the principles of peace--the principles on which the United Nations is rounded--we must maintain strong armed forces. Any uncertainty as to the ability or the willingness of the free nations of the world to defend themselves is just an invitation to aggression.

We must take advantage of the new opportunities, the increased demands which result from the natural growth of our population.

7,"7_33","Address in Little Rock at the Dedication of the World War Memorial Park.","Harry S. Truman","June 11, 1949","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","We have come a long way toward correcting these evils.

The people of these countries would be thrown into confusion and their advance toward economic self-reliance would be blocked. A slash in the funds available for European recovery at this time would be the worst kind of economy. It would cancel the hopes and the plans of the Western European nations. It would be a great gain for communism.",0,"-","-","-","-"

Truman","June 11, 1949","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","I have offered a program for bringing these people the benefits of our modern civilization. It is not a program of relief. While it is intended ultimately to bring about a great movement of capital through the channels of private investment for the development of these poverty-stricken regions, it is not a program of imperialism. The development of these areas offers enormous potential benefits to a growing world economy.",0,"-","-","-","-"
7,"7_42","Address in Little Rock at the Dedication of the World War Memorial Park.","Harry S.

7,"7_43","Address in Little Rock at the Dedication of the World War Memorial Park.","Harry S. Truman","June 11, 1949","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","The third condition essential for peace is an international structure capable of suppressing international violence. However well conceived our economic programs may be, they cannot succeed unless there is some assurance against the outbreak of aggression. Neither our own prosperity nor the prosperity of other nations can survive unless we can protect the operations of economic life from the threat of war.",0,"-","-","-","-"
7,"7_44","Address in Little Rock at the Dedication of the World War Memorial Park.","Harry S.

Within the terms of the United Nations Charter, we and certain other countries have undertaken to provide greater assurance against the danger of armed conflict. That is the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty. The idea behind this treaty--the association of democratic nations for mutual defense-is well understood in this country. Perhaps we do not understand, however, the importance of this pact in the eyes of the other democratic nations which are parties to it. They have been greatly weakened by war. They have been haunted by the fear of again becoming the scene of conflict. By assuring them of our support the pact goes a long way to dispel their fears.",1,"-","-","-","-"

The burdens we have had to assume in this enterprise have been enormous and unusual. Never in the history of the world has the victor contributed to the recovery of the vanquished as this country has done after the Second World War.

604,"604_31","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","Let me capsule it very simply in this way: Before the Mideast war broke out, we had a serious energy problem in the United States.

604,"604_32","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","It is the fact that, for example, more people have television, more people use more lights, more heat, there are more cars using more gasoline.

604,"604_33","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","We had to get more sources.

604,"604_35","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","Now, coming beyond that, however, as we look at our energy problem, as I described it, a serious problem, what was a serious problem in April--and the Congress did consider it serious but not serious enough to act upon it--became a crisis as a result of the Mideast.",0,"-","-","-","-"
604,"604_36","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","Now, one thing I must warn this audience and the American people about, now that we see that we have already had a cease-fire in the Mideast, now that we see negotiations beginning that hold out the hope that some of the Arab nations that have oil may relent with regard to their oil embargo and let the oil come in, some may get the impression, well, if we begin to get the Mideast oil again, then there will be no energy crisis which the President had described a few days ago in his remarks, and we can go back to driving 70 miles an hour rather than 50 miles an hour, and we can turn up our heat in our home from 68 to 78 or 88, or higher yet, if you want to go someplace that I don't want to go to.

604,"604_37","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","But the point is, we have already lost, my friends, we have already lost 6 weeks of oil from the Mideast. Even if the thing were settled in the next e weeks, we would have lost 2 months. We may lose 3 months. And so the crisis is there, and that is why these extraordinary measures have been taken and why we urge your cooperation voluntarily in seeing that across this Nation we have enough light, enough transportation, enough heat, but not more than we need, so that everybody sacrifices a little, and no one, then, will have to suffer at all. That is the program, and I hope that you will support it.",0,"-","-","-","-"
604,"604_38","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","But again, putting it in parallel with the Mideast situation, it is so easy to say, as in the Mideast, """"Well, we have a cease-fire,"""" and then relax, and then 7 or 8 years from now another war and an even closer possibility of confrontation between the super powers.",0,"-","-","-","-"
604,"604_39","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","In the Mideast we have not been satisfied with that. We are moving from the cease-fire toward a permanent settlement, and in energy we must not be satisfied with doing enough this year to take care of our heating and transportation and lighting and power to run our factories and farms, and so forth, and feel that if we do enough this year, then maybe next year we can go back to business as usual.",0,"-","-","-","-"
604,"604_40","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","And that is why I have set a goal for the United States, one that I ask all Americans to join in. In the year 1976, as you know, we will be celebrating our 200th birthday, and that, of course, is a great birthday because it is the birthday of our independence. I was hoping that we could also set as a goal for the year 1976, our national independence birthday, a goal of being self-sufficient in energy so that no nation, not an Arab country, not a Latin American country, not even. our Canadian friends--they are pretty tough on us at times, too, you know, when they are looking down our throats, and I understand it, and we do not complain about it, because that is the way the business world works, but the point that I make is this:",0,"-","-","-","-"
604,"604_41","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","The United States of America is a great nation. No great nation must ever be in the position where it is dependent on any other nation, friend or foe, for its energy. That does not mean that we will not continue to desire the oil of the Mideast, and try to develop the gas resources, perhaps, in Siberia, and work with our friends in Canada and Latin America, and so forth, for trade and all that kind of thing. But it does mean that the United States must be independent in this area, and we can be, and we can be by 1980, and I will tell you how.",0,"-","-","-","-"
604,"604_42","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","First, coal. We have half the coal resources of the world in the United States.

604,"604_44","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","And second, we must find ways to make coal a cleaner fuel, and through a process that we are now going through of maximum research, we are finding ways where coal can be made a cleaner fuel through degasification and the like. And so coal is one of our potentials to make us self-sufficient in energy.",0,"-","-","-","-"
604,"604_45","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","A second area is natural gas. Here we run right counter to great political forces, which I well understand. In order to get more natural gas, which is the cleanest fuel we could possibly have, or a very clean fuel, I should say, because nuclear power is probably cleaner than natural gas, but in order to get more natural gas, the old law of supply and demand works. And at the present time, the price for natural gas is held so artificially low that wells that could produce it and wells that could be drilled anew to produce it are not producing it and are not being drilled.",0,"-","-","-","-"
604,"604_46","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","Now, we need the gas. In order to get it, we have got to deregulate so that the price can go up, not a price where the American consumer pays an exorbitant price, because as that supply goes up that demand, of course, will also eat it up, and eventually the price situation will, I think, take care of itself. But it doesn't make any sense to keep the gas in the ground at a time that people in New England are going around cold because they don't have the fuel they need. We have got to get it out of the ground, and that is why the deregulation of natural gas is important. And I would hope that the Congress, after due consideration of all the price factors and the rest, will act expeditiously now on this particular matter.",0,"-","-","-","-"
604,"604_47","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","The third area--there are others that could be mentioned--is nuclear power. And here, as educators of your country-and I know that real estate people are educators to an extent. You spend long days in which you never make a sale. You spend long days when people come in there and put their feet up on the desk and they waste your time and talk about things, but that is a time to do some educating, and I want to tell you what I think you can do in this particular area.",0,"-","-","-","-"
604,"604_48","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","In the field of nuclear power, there is a fear syndrome in the United States. Because nuclear power created the greatest destructive force the world has ever known, there is the feeling that the use of nuclear power for peaceful purposes should not even be explored. I live 12 miles from a nuclear power plant in California, and I am not afraid, and none of my neighbors are afraid. It is safe; it is clean; it is necessary. And the United States, which was the first to develop nuclear power, must now go forward to develop it for peaceful purposes so that by the year 1980 we can have all the power that we need.",0,"-","-","-","-"
604,"604_49","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","And now let me come to a critical question-realtors. Realtors, of course, believe in this country. Realtors believe that real estate, American real estate, is the best investment you can make, not only in real estate or probably in anything else. I didn't check with my New York stockbrokers to see whether or not they agreed with that--the ones I formerly knew-but nevertheless, I think most of them are now saying, have your portfolio with some real estate in it as well as common stocks and bonds.

604,"604_50","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","The point is, when I have been talking here, I have been talking about extracting coal and making it a clean fuel, and in the meantime using it even when it isn't clean if it is necessary in order to have the energy that produces our jobs and keeps us warm and keeps us moving.",0,"-","-","-","-"
604,"604_51","Remarks at the National Association of Realtors Annual Convention.","Richard Nixon","November 15, 1973","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","Second, I have been talking about nuclear power and nuclear power also runs into the problem that some people who are desperately concerned about the environment, the beauty of America, as I am concerned, and as you are concerned, they wonder, should we develop nuclear power, might it have a detrimental effect on the environment?",0,"-","-","-","-"

Some might even go around the southern coast of South America. Others might choose to off load on the east or west coast or the gulf coast and let rail shipment replace transit shipment. But I think that even if the use of the canal doesn't increase in the future, that the fees will be much less, for instance, than they are with the Suez Canal, and with any increase in the use of the canal, it's almost inevitable, in my opinion, as we start shipping more and more oil and natural gas from Alaska, down around the coast, through the canal up to the gulf coast, that as you increase the volume of shipment through the canal, then the fees per ton will go down.",0,"-","-","-","-"

We've got legal rulings on the constitutionality of my signing the treaties and the Senate advising and consenting toward the ratification of the treaties.

For instance, a very crucial element of the treaties themselves will be the establishment of the nine-person board to which I just referred. Now the Panama Canal Corporation is a private nongovernmental entity. After the canal treaties are ratified, then that will be replaced by a government agency which will consist of this nine-person board, and the House and Senate will have to approve the establishment of that board. So, that's one of the necessary parts of the completion of the treaty process. So, the House will have an adequate chance to participate in that.

Current U.S. policy deals with several problem areas: economic structural factors, including the yen-dollar relationship, and trade liberalization, among others. There are no quick or easy fixes. In the area of trade liberalization, the sectoral trade negotiations under the Market Oriented Sector Specific discussions (MOSS) have been a valuable tool for resolving problems in a cooperative, trade-expanding manner. The United States and Japan have agreed to continue this effort, to follow up on what has been accomplished thus far, and to start work on new sectors as well.

His departure marks the end of 3 historic days here in Washington in which Mr. Gorbachev and I continued to build a foundation for better relations between our governments and our peoples.

They now cover a far broader agenda, one that has, at its root, realism and candor. Let me explain this with a saying I've often repeated: Nations do not distrust each other because they're armed; they are armed because they distrust each other. And just as real peace means the presence of freedom and justice as well as the absence of war, so, too, summits must be discussions not just about arms but about the fundamental differences that cause nations to be armed.",0,"-","-","-","-"

In this way, we have put Soviet-American relations on a far more candid and far more realistic footing. It also means that, while there's movement-indeed, dramatic movement—in the arms reduction area, much remains to be done in that area as well as in these other critical areas that I've mentioned, especially—and this goes without saying—in advancing our goal of a world open to the expansion of human freedom and the growth of democratic government.",0,"-","-","-","-"

In the mid- and late-1970's the Soviets began to deploy hundreds of new, mobile intermediate-range missiles capable of destroying major cities and military installations in Europe and Asia.

First, we would deploy a limited number of our own INF missiles as a deterrent, but at the same time push hard in negotiations to do away with this entirely new nuclear threat. And we set out to do this with a formula I first put forward in 1981. It was called the zero-option. It meant the complete elimination of these missiles on both sides. Well, at first, many called this a mere propaganda ploy, some even here in this country. But we were persistent, our allies steadfast, and eventually the Soviets returned to the bargaining table. The result is our INF treaty.",1,"-","-","-","-"

Under the terms of this treaty, we will be eliminating 400 deployed warheads, while the Soviet Union eliminates 1,600, or four times as many. Now, let me also point out that this does not, however, leave NATO unprotected. In fact, we will maintain a substantial deterrent force on the ground, in the air, and at sea. Our commitment to NATO's strategy of being able to respond as necessary to any form of aggression remains steadfast.",1,"-","-","-","-"

This effort makes even less sense when the Soviets aren't even abiding by the ABM treaty, while we are. Virtually all experts, even some of our biggest critics, agree that the Soviet construction of the large, phased-array radar at Krasnoyarsk is an out-and-out violation of the ABM treaty.",0,"-","-","-","-"
1261,"1261_13","Remarks to the Institute for Foreign Policy Analysis at a Conference on the Strategic Defense Initiative","Ronald Reagan","March 14, 1988","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","A few months ago, I raised a serious specter. I pointed out that it is not only in the development of strategic defenses that the United States could be left behind. A recent report released by the Department of Defense called """"The Soviet Space Challenge"""" warns that the Soviet space program points in one disturbing direction, and I quote: """"the methodical pursuit of a war-fighting capability in space."""" Soviet launch capacity far outstrips our own. We should be concerned that, together with the Long-standing program and the construction of the Krasnoyarsk radar as part of an updated early warning system, the Soviets may be preparing a nationwide ABM defense of their territory. In other words, they may be preparing to break out of the ABM treaty. In that eventuality, without SDI, we would be dangerously unprepared.",0,"-","-","-","-"

Well, that is, to put it plainly, irresponsible in the extreme. The fact is that many Americans are unaware that at this moment the United States has absolutely zero defenses against a ballistic missile attack. If even one missile were to be accidentally fired at the United States, the President would have no way of preventing the wholesale destruction of American lives. All he could do is retaliate—wipe out millions of lives on the other side. This is the position we find ourselves in; to perpetuate it forever is simply morally untenable. Vengeance is not the American way. It certainly cannot form any plausible Long-standing basis for Western strategy if a better form of deterrence can be established. Flexible response has worked. And we, of course, remain committed to our present strategy, but we remain equally committed to our search for a safer way to deter aggression.",0,"-","-","-","-"

The development and deployment of an initial phase, when it is ready, will be undertaken in such a way that it provides a solid foundation for a continued evolution toward a fully comprehensive defense system, which is SDI's ultimate goal. Among the objectives of this first phase will be to strengthen deterrence by denying the Soviet Union confidence in their ability to achieve any objectives through the use of ballistic missiles. It will also protect the population of the United States and its allies against an accidental launch of ballistic missiles.

SDI will likely prove instrumental here, too, by providing high-tech spin-offs for NATO's Conventional Defenses Initiative, CDI, that could help to address the imbalance of forces in Europe. And SDI helps to solve what is perhaps the greatest paradox of arms reduction: that reductions, if not carefully managed, could mean greater instability and risk. As arms are reduced to lower and lower levels, each violation could become more and more threatening. SDI can play a key role in solving this paradox of nuclear arms reductions. We may build an edifice of peace and arms reductions, but just like your homes, it needs an insurance policy against fire and theft.

I spoke about when I was in college and a debate that I remember having in one of my classes in those post-World War I days, when the bomber was just being recognized as the potent weapon that it later became. Our class debated whether or not Americans—people who, to our way of thinking, stood for high moral standards—would ever drop bombs from a plane on a city. And the class was about evenly divided. Half felt it might be necessary. The other felt that bombing civilians would always be beyond the pale of decency, totally unacceptable human conduct, no matter how heinous the enemy. We believed that young men in America would refuse such an order. But a decade later, during World War II, few, if any, who had been in that room objected to our country's wholesale bombing of cities under the hard pressures of total war.

Those who say it can't be done, who stand in the way of progress and insist that technology stops here—I plead with them to consider what they're saying. For no matter how effective arms reduction negotiations ever are, we can never """"uninvent"""" the nuclear weapon. We can never erase the knowledge of how to build a ballistic missile.

And the world still calls on us to promote democracy, for even though democracy is on the march in many places in the world, you and I know that it has been thwarted in many places, too.

When I was growing up, business was mostly a local affair.

We're angry when we see jobs and factories moving overseas or across the borders or depressing wages here at home when we think there is nothing we can do about it.

Even though 60 developing nations have reduced their trade barriers in recent years, when you add up the sum of their collective actions, 20 of the 24 developed nations have actually increased their trade barriers in recent years.

1539,"1539_43","Remarks at the American University Centennial Celebration","William J. Clinton","February 26, 1993","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","We must do both.

I am genuinely open to new ideas to cut inessential spending and to make the kinds of dramatic changes in the way Government works that all of us know we have to make. I don't care whether they come from Republicans or Democrats, or I don't even care whether they come from at home or abroad.

For too long, debates over trade have been dominated by voices from the extremes. One says Government should build walls to protect firms from competition. Another says Government should do nothing in the face of foreign competition, no matter what the dimension and shape of that competition is, no matter what the consequences are in terms of job losses, trade dislocations, or crushed incomes. Neither view takes on the hard work of creating a more open trading system that enables us and our trading partners to prosper.

Better educated and trained workers, a lower deficit, stable, low interest rates, a reformed health care system, world-class technologies, revived cities: These must be the steel of our competitive edge.

I have seen it in Korea, as a country has become more progressive and more open.

Non-nuclear-weapon states that sign on to the treaty pledge never to acquire them.

I saw a lot of children who were innocently caught in crossfires in this kind of thing. All the law enforcement agencies in the country asked for help on the assault weapons ban. So I supported it. But the bill that I passed also contained a list of 650 sporting weapons that could not be in any way infringed by Federal action, that were protected.

The third thing we've tried to do through NATO is to support the British, the French, the Canadian, and the other European troops that are in Bosnia in their peacekeeping efforts. We have tried to make sure that we created safe areas in the eastern enclaves and around Sarajevo, that we tried to collect all the heavy weapons that the Serbs have which give them such an enormous advantage on the battlefield.

1726,"1726_21","Remarks at a Town Meeting in Billings, Montana","William J. Clinton","June 01, 1995","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","The President. Well, first of all, I think one of the things that has happened is that increasingly in this information age, with all this explosion of access to information, one of the things that's happening that's not good is that people are more and more and more listening to people who tell them just what they want to hear or play on their own fears. And that's isolating us. One reason I like this is that there are a lot of people here of different points of view. So I think—I would urge you to urge them to open their ears and eyes to different points of view. Now, let me just deal with the three issues you mentioned. You mentioned welfare; you mentioned Government regulation; you mentioned taxes.",0,"-","-","-","-"

Clinton","June 01, 1995","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","On the welfare issue, most Americans believe, I learned from a recent poll, that we're spending 45 percent of your money on foreign aid and welfare. In fact, we're spending about a nickel of your money on foreign aid and welfare, your tax money. For the last 2 years, 2 1/2 years, I have done everything I could to convince the Congress to pass a welfare reform bill which would invest more in work and require people on welfare to move to work and would give people who are parents of small children the ability to work and still see that their kids are taken care of. When that has not happened, I have given 29 States now the permission to get out from under all these Federal rules and regulations and adopt their own plans to move people from welfare to work.",0,"-","-","-","-"

We're going to cut enough paperwork this year to stretch page by page from New York to San Francisco. So if you want me to defend Government regulation, you're talking to the wrong person. I can't even defend everything that's been done since I've been here, because I believe we do have to change the way the Government works. But the final thing I would tell you is, I do not believe that we should abandon our commitment to a clean environment and to the quality of life that makes everybody in the world want to live in a place like Montana.

And I have done what I could to bring it down for middle class people who are overtaxed.

First of all, I want to thank your father for serving his country by working for the Federal Government. Maybe the most important thing I can do is to remind the American people that the people who work for the Federal Government are citizens and human beings too. And I think the one thing that happened in Oklahoma City is a lot of people realized all of a sudden that all of these people we deride all the time for working for the Federal Government are people that go to church with us, that send their kids to our schools and show up at the softball parks and the bowling alleys and contribute to the United Way.",0,"-","-","-","-"

But it just stands to reason, given the tailings and the other dimensions of the mining project, that it's going to have to meet a very high standard before you can be absolutely certain you're not doing anything to Clark Fork or to Yellowstone.

First of all, since I've been President we've raised the loan rate once, as you probably know. I have also tried to do two other things for farmers, particularly farmers in this part of our country. One is to find more markets to sell products and to use things like the Export Enhancement Program, the EEP program, to help to facilitate those sales. The other is to try to give you some protection from unfair competition. You know, our administration moved to get that moratorium on increased imports from Canada, and we set up that commission to work on that problem, on the wheat issue.

1726,"1726_49","Remarks at a Town Meeting in Billings, Montana","William J.

It used to be when agricultural exports went up, farm income went up. It doesn't necessarily happen anymore. It used to be if you could get more jobs into the American economy, people's wages would rise. If you'd told me 2 1/2 years ago that I could get the Congress to lower the deficit 3 years in a row for the first time since Mr. Truman was President and increase investment in education and technology and expand trade for American products and create 6.3 million new jobs, but the incomes of most working Americans wouldn't go up, I wouldn't have believed that.

1726,"1726_50","Remarks at a Town Meeting in Billings, Montana","William J. Clinton","June 01, 1995","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","Now, here's what's going to happen in agriculture in this farm debate, and I'll tell you what I'm going to try to do. The Congress has said we ought to cut another $8 billion or $9 billion out of farm supports. Farm supports were cut in '85; they were cut in '90; they were cut modestly in '93. They've been cut modestly in '95 by me because the Europeans are having to cut more under the GATT deal we made. If we cut $8 billion or $9 billion in farm supports, in my opinion, two things are going to happen. Number one, we're going to produce less and lose markets overseas, and number two, more family farmers will go out and corporate farmers will come in.",0,"-","-","-","-"
1726,"1726_51","Remarks at a Town Meeting in Billings, Montana","William J.

The other is to enable efficient family farmers to ride through the hard years. Corporations don't need that; they can either borrow the money or have cash reserves to ride through the hard years. So I'm going to be pushing for changes in this farm bill which help preserve family farmers instead of changes which undermine them. And I told a bunch of farmers I met with today near here at the Les Auer's farm, I said, you know, what we need to do is not only look at how much this budget's going to be cut but how this farm program is going to be structured, because if we don't do it, family farmers, without regard to their politics, are going to be in trouble.",0,"-","-","-","-"

Look at—even in Montana, with the relatively small population you have, you have a lot of people with different views on every issue. But I'm telling you, it's our meal ticket to the global economy. And we have got to find a way, in a community setting like this, to stop looking at each other as enemies and start looking at each other as friends and neighbors even when we have differences and try to find a way to resolve the differences, instead of drive wedges into the differences, make them bigger, so we can belong to organizations that will hate each other more than we did before and we give all our money to keep driving ourselves apart instead of spending our money to bring ourselves together.

Well, first of all, yes, it would be possible to do that. Let me say with regard to your assertion about mismanagement, I don't necessarily agree with that. It is true that the Congress raised the Social Security tax back in 1983 because the Social Security Trust Fund was in trouble, because the American people kept demanding opportunities for people to retire at younger ages while we were living to be older and older. So they decided to gradually, a month a year, over a period of several years, raise the retirement age to 67. They funded the thing better, and then they essentially used the Social Security tax to downplay the deficit, which meant that most of the Social Security money was being invested in Government bonds.",0,"-","-","-","-"

That may be true, but we'd have to be willing to assume a higher rate of risk as well. And that's one of the things we're debating now.",0,"-","-","-","-"
1726,"1726_63","Remarks at a Town Meeting in Billings, Montana","William J.

The health care reforms that I proposed last year did not pass. But there are two things that I think we ought to do that would make a huge difference to people with HIV and all of their family members and friends. The most important is to try to provide some alternatives to either no care or nursing home care in the home or in boarding homes, some other options for long-term care for families. That's also a big deal for people with disabled relatives and people with parents that maybe don't need to be in a nursing home but need some help. I believe that that ought to be part of all these arguments about cutting Medicare and Medicaid. It ought to be done in the context of health care reform, and we ought to push for that again.

The Attorney General is reviewing that, and there is a commission, you know, that's supposed to make recommendations on it. I have to tell you, all of you folks, that the Federal Government adopted these sentencing guidelines to get out of the feeling a lot of Americans had that the sentence a person got and the time a person did was totally arbitrary, that it varied so dramatically from judge to judge and State to State that it was hard to believe that justice was ever being done. And some people, it would seem, would do something terrible and not do any time at all. So we went to the sentencing guidelines.",0,"-","-","-","-"

Again, we live in an age where there are a lot of complicated problems that don't have simple answers, but those 30-second bullets that come screaming over the air waves like—seem to have a simple answer.

But the truth is, we send more people to jail and keep them longer there than any other country does. And I'm all for it if they're the right people, if they're the dangerous people that shouldn't be let out, that ought to be kept behind bars.

When I was a boy, I lived on a farm in Arkansas that had sheep and goats and cattle, and I nearly got killed by a ram; so I'm glad that your sheep are well-behaved.

1726,"1726_84","Remarks at a Town Meeting in Billings, Montana","William J.

Somewhere between $200 and $300 million was spent to advertise to convince the American people we were trying to have the Government take over health care. And the American people basically wound up believing it, so that Congress could get off by just walking away from it. That's essentially what happened. I don't think it was true.",0,"-","-","-","-"
1726,"1726_85","Remarks at a Town Meeting in Billings, Montana","William J. Clinton","June 01, 1995","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","On the other hand, the second thing that happened was, I have to take responsibility— not my wife, not anybody else, me, because I've been in this business a long time—for biting off more than we could chew at once. Health care is one-seventh of our economy. It's the number one concern for a lot of people when they get sick. And there is only so much change you can accommodate at one time. I think that I have to take responsibility for making our plan vulnerable to being both distorted but also to failing, and I regret that very much.",0,"-","-","-","-"
1726,"1726_86","Remarks at a Town Meeting in Billings, Montana","William J. Clinton","June 01, 1995","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","So what are we going to do now? Because every year, more and more working people don't have health insurance. Every year, more and more people who are self-employed or farmers or people in small businesses can't afford to buy insurance or have to pay more for less coverage. And every year, more and more cost gets either put off onto the Government or onto people that do have good insurance policies. Now, if we cut Medicare and Medicaid and take that money away from hospitals in Montana and Arkansas and other places and New York City, that will put even more pressure on either closing hospitals or raising insurance rates for people that have good insurance. So this is a very complicated thing.",0,"-","-","-","-"
1726,"1726_87","Remarks at a Town Meeting in Billings, Montana","William J. Clinton","June 01, 1995","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","My answer to you is twofold. Number one, if it is appropriate, that is, depending on what we do this year, I'll certainly intend to discuss the health care in the context of the campaign in 1996. But, number two, remember I have said to the American people all along Medicare and Medicaid are going up too fast; I agree with the Republican majority in Congress on that. We won't have any money for anything else if we continue to have to spend 10 percent, 11 percent more every year for Medicare and Medicaid. That's the only—look, under my budgets, everything else is virtually flat or declining. On the other hand, you can't just cut it without trying to reform the system. And I believe there are some important medical reforms that can be done this year that would make health care more available and more affordable to people and would reduce some of the disruption that's otherwise going to come if you just have huge cuts in Medicare and Medicaid.",0,"-","-","-","-"

You remember the House passed a line-item veto on President Reagan's birthday as a present for him; that was weeks ago, right? The line-item veto—one of the things the Republican Congress said that was essential to cut spending—I said, """"Give it to me. I'll cut it."""" Do you know—so we had a line-item veto pass the House, a line-item veto pass the Senate, and I am still waiting for a conference committee to be appointed.

They wanted to cut some money out of this year's budget to make a downpayment on balancing the budget. That's what this socalled rescission bill is. They wanted to do it so they would raise money to pay for Oklahoma City, the California earthquake, and the floods that are now going on in the Middle West and still have some money to bring the deficit down starting this year even more. And I said, fine. They said $16 billion; I said, fine. I met with the Republican Senators, and we worked out an agreement. And then all the Democratic Senators, just about, voted for it. It was a great deal, right? So then they go behind closed doors, and they take a billion four that we agreed on spending on education and health care and veterans and a bunch of other stuff out and put in a billion four worth of courthouses and special street and road projects and some other things.",0,"-","-","-","-"

This is a one-time savings, all right, and you can argue that the power is subsidized, but I will approve this only if you do two things, in our proposal. One is you have to put a lid on how much rates can go up, and two—which makes it less attractive, obviously, to private utilities. And two is there has to be an extraordinary effort to let public power authorities buy the capacity first, which would, in effect—since they're getting it, since the power marketing authorities primarily sell to public power authorities, as you know—which would essentially be a change of assets; you could take it off the government's books, it would look like you lowered the deficit, but it wouldn't lead to a rate increase because you'd have the same integrated network.",0,"-","-","-","-"

The answer to that is yes, if for no other reason, not just because of what your people may be exposed to but because one of the reasons we decided to destroy all this before I ever came along—my predecessors made that decision, it was the right one—is that you don't want even small amounts of these kinds of chemicals in the wrong hands—can be used for very bad things.",0,"-","-","-","-"

I don't know enough now to give you a sensible answer, but you've asked a good question, and I will get an answer, and I'll get back to you. And let me just make one other point on this. Some of the opponents of the Chemical Weapons Convention say, """"Well, you know, you can't protect everybody against everything.""""

Now, maybe they could or could not do that once the chemical weapons regime is fully in force and we have much tighter restrictions on what can cross national lines. But one thing we know for sure: Japan has already ratified this treaty because they have suffered through this, and they know even if somebody who has got a half-cocked idea and a home-baked laboratory can go out and do something terrible like this, there will be fewer incidents like this if we pass the Chemical Weapons Convention.",0,"-","-","-","-"

But that goes back to the question the gentleman from Alabama asked, and it's one of the reasons we want to destroy our stockpiles as quickly as possible, because, in addition to the risks that people in the area are exposed to, we want to minimize the chances that anybody ever can get their hands on any of this for mischievous, evil purposes.",0,"-","-","-","-"

In general, obviously no one country can change the body of a treaty which has already been ratified by other countries; we can't do that, and lots of other countries have ratified it. But every country is empowered to, in effect, attach a set of understandings as to what the treaty means, and as long as they're not plainly inconsistent with the thrust of the document and don't vitiate it, they can go forward. And one of the things we've been doing with a lot of the opponents and the skeptics of the treaty—Senator Helms, for example, and others raised, I think, 30 different questions in the beginning, and we have reached agreement, I believe, in 20 of those 30 areas, and we've offered alternatives that we believe are reasonable in the other areas.",0,"-","-","-","-"

And the concern would be, well, what if Iran is attacked by Iraq, and the United States and Germany, for example, give them a lot of sophisticated defense technology on chemical weapons, and they turn around and use the chemical weapons against someone else—in other words, if they turned out to have lied about their promise in the treaty?

It will be a great, great challenge. It's a challenge that, by the way, I think the newspapers of the country can do a lot to help promote in terms of advancing dialogue, diversifying your own staffs, doing the things that will help America to come to grips with what it means not to be a country with a legacy of slavery and the differences between blacks and whites but to have grafted onto that not only the immigration patterns of the early 20th century but what is happening to us now.",0,"-","-","-","-"

And I believe we did the right thing in the last 4 years to conclude over 200 trade agreements, the largest trade record of any administration in the history of the country.

The deficit's been cut by 77 percent. You heard Tom Daschle say we produced 12 million jobs for the first time in history in a 4-year period and the lowest unemployment rate in 24 years. Our approach was right, and they were not, and that's why we got a budget agreement today that will enable us to balance the budget.

Clinton","June 04, 1999","Press, Interviews, Presidential","The President. Well, first of all, a lot of avid sports people would tell you that they do some of that with handguns, too. But generally, yes, I think there's a big difference between assault weapons and other weapons. Some people claim they use them for sporting purposes, but no one needs them. And there is a difference between handguns and other weapons, because handguns are used more, they're easier to conceal, and they're more likely to be used for illegal purposes and less likely to be used for legal purposes. Therefore, I think it is legitimate to have higher standards on owning them and greater requirements on background checks and greater requirements on whether they should be registered or not. That's what I believe.",0,"-","-","-","-"

And a lot of countries had come from a different style of government and a different type of security arrangements to one in which free nations were bound together. And so the expansion of NATO and the offering of—sending a positive signal to Georgia and Ukraine recently has been an incredibly positive accomplishment.

But as was the case in Iraq, we can't do for Afghans what they must ultimately do for themselves. That's why we're training Afghan security forces and supporting a political resolution to Afghanistan's problems. And next August, we will begin a transition to Afghan responsibility.

We are not listening to everybody. And I think it's very important to make that clear. And this is part of the reason why it is going to take time to win back trust, because there's been so much sensationalism around these issues. One of the issues that I discussed for example today, the 215 program of telephone metadata, that I've determined we will end government collection of this data. But this is data that does not include names, does not include content. It is essentially a series of phone numbers so that when we have a specific lead ? let's say we find a number in an Al-Qaeda compound ? we can find out whether that number contacted a number inside the United States or, for that matter, inside of Germany. And there are legitimate concerns, though, about the government holding this data and those are some of the concerns that we have tried to address.",0,"-","-","-","-"

Here in the United States, as I mentioned, there have been times where surveillance has been abused.

In some ways, it is parallel to the fact that our military capabilities and our budgets are significantly greater than others'. Now, you can look at that in two ways. Because we have greater capabilities it also means we have greater responsibilities for humanitarian assistance for helping to keep our allies safe. I think it's fair to say that there are a whole series of European countries who are very glad that the US has those military capabilities and intelligence capabilities. And so in some ways we underwrite a lot of the security needs and defenses of countries around the world.

During this unprecedented gathering, we opened a new center to combat extremist ideology, launched a task force to block funding for terrorists, and agreed to massive economic development deals, the likes of which there has never been, that will create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the United States, building the equipment that has just been ordered by Saudi Arabia.",0,"-","-","-","-"

Other member nations must pay more. The U.S. is currently paying much more than any other nation, and that is not fair to the United States or the United States taxpayer. So we're working on it, and I will tell you, a big difference over the last year. Money is actually starting to pour into NATO from countries that would not have been doing what they're doing now had I not been elected, I can tell you that. Money is starting to pour in. It's only fair to the United States. We want to be treated fairly. And we're behind NATO all the way, but we want to be treated fairly.

On the night of July 9, 1943, Parle was among the tens of thousands of Allied forces preparing for a surprise landing the next morning on the shores of Sicily, right here, about 70 miles away, to be exact.

The boat was filled with explosives. He knew that if he didn't stop the fire, an explosion would light up the night sky, alert the enemy, all of his fellow comrades would be killed, and the invasion would be a failure. So Parle rushed to the source of smoke, hardly able to breathe, breathing the smoke in, and without a thought for his own safety, picked up the burning device with his bare hands, ran to the side of the boat, and hurled it into the sea as far as he could throw.",0,"-","-","-","-"

So the Allied forces went on to win the Sicily campaign. Critical in their ultimate victory was Parle.
