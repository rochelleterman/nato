The United Nations is designed to give every nation a share in forming decisions on world issues. Such an organization will have its difficulties. We all know, from our own experience in business, in unions, in cooperatives, or fraternal groups, how much hard work and honest give and take is required to make this kind of organization successful. But we also know that in the long run an organization based on voluntary agreement among its members will command greater loyalty, speak with greater authority, and have a greater chance for success than any other kind.

In the past, attempts to organize the world by force have always failed. The most recent failure was the attempt of Nazi Germany to establish European unity through the rule of force. This attempt to create an empire by conquest lasted only a few years.",0,"-","-","-","-"

Their doctrine calls for the destruction of free governments through the use of force and the effort to create class warfare.

It is incapable of satisfying the needs and desires of men for a better life. In its inner structure, it manifests the fatal weaknesses of all dictatorships.

9,"9_34","Address in Chicago Before the Imperial Council Session of the Shrine of North America.","Harry S. Truman","July 19, 1949","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","The reason is clear. Our idea of democracy speaks in terms which men can understand. It speaks of opportunity and tolerance and self-government. It speaks of the dignity of the individual, his freedom of conscience and the right to worship as he pleases. It does not exact blind loyalty to false ideas or improbable theories. It does not make a god out of the state, or out of man, or out of any human creation.",0,"-","-","-","-"

If we were to make our plans on the assumption that employment and production will get smaller, we would only make matters worse, and waste much of our potential economic strength. What we must do, instead, is to make all our plans, private and public, in such a way as to give us more jobs and more output. This is the way toward a stronger economy.",0,"-","-","-","-"

One of the most foolish things we could do right now would be to slash our appropriations for European recovery.

The General knows all this. He was faced with these very same problems only recently, when he was giving great service to this country as a military leader.

588,"588_37","Remarks at the American Legion's Annual National Convention in Chicago, Illinois.","Richard Nixon","August 24, 1972","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","We have cut our defense budget in terms of its burden on our American economy.

We are ahead in some areas; they are ahead in others.

588,"588_41","Remarks at the American Legion's Annual National Convention in Chicago, Illinois.","Richard Nixon","August 24, 1972","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","If we want to keep the United States from having the second best defense, we must recognize that if we should take the Minuteman III program, the Poseidon missile program, and if we should halt the development of those programs, it would mean that the United States would be the second strongest country in the world in missiles.

588,"588_44","Remarks at the American Legion's Annual National Convention in Chicago, Illinois.","Richard Nixon","August 24, 1972","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","What this adds up to, my friends, very simply is this: We would be second on the ground; we would be second in air power; we would be second in terms of missiles; and we would be second as far as the Navy is concerned.

588,"588_48","Remarks at the American Legion's Annual National Convention in Chicago, Illinois.","Richard Nixon","August 24, 1972","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","Let's look at another point, looking to the future. If we were to cut back the money going into research and development for a more modern national defense, we risk the safety of the next generation of Americans, because this I know: The Soviet Union is not cutting back on its research and development.",0,"-","-","-","-"
588,"588_49","Remarks at the American Legion's Annual National Convention in Chicago, Illinois.","Richard Nixon","August 24, 1972","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","Let us remember: We have made a significant step forward in our talks with the Soviets, but it was hard-headed bargaining. We expected them to bargain hard. We bargained hard. We have had the first step taken to limit nuclear arms.

628,"628_37","Remarks in Louisville, Kentucky.","Gerald R.

But if we are going to win the battle against inflation, we have to accept and fight for and be dedicated to this kind of sound economics. It calls for a little sacrifice upon the part of every one of us. It calls upon us to be compassionate, because we are going through a traumatic experience that I suspect few of you had anything to do in creating.

If we don't, if we just abandon our responsibility, this kind of inflation will tear the fabric of our political society asunder. It will destroy what we have inherited from those that preceded us. It will completely knock out the capabilities of the United States to be the leader in the world in trying to solve the problems of peace, whether it is in the Mediterranean, the Middle East, Greece and Turkey, whether it is in Western Europe, or Southeast Asia. If we don't have a strong economy at home, we can't go to the other countries with the firm hand and the respect that is so essential to get them to solve their problems wherever they might be in the world as a whole.",0,"-","-","-","-"

I say John Sherman Cooper, who is going to be our Ambassador to East Germany, Thruston Morton, who was an Assistant Secretary of State as well as a Member of the Senate and Member of the House--they come from the Bluegrass, but they had a vision infinitely beyond that. And they know, as well as I do, that America at this moment has a responsibility as well as an opportunity to do things that no other nation in the free world side can do to help solve those problems in the Middle East, to negotiate the differences between two good allies--Greece and Turkey--to keep NATO together, to work in the vineyard in trying to achieve a responsible policy of detente with the Soviet Union, to open up new vistas in the Pacific with the People's Republic.",1,"-","-","-","-"

So I had in the House of Representatives 12 years on the Defense Appropriations Committee that met 5 days a week, 5 hours a day, 7 months a year, listening to Secretaries of Defense, Secretaries of Army, Navy, Air Force, admirals, generals, you have it.

So, isn't it better to have more warheads than missiles? Our missiles and warheads are more accurate than theirs, and accuracy is a very important thing in a weapons system that goes 5,000 miles.

It is extremely complicated. It is rapidly changing in its tactical confrontations on a day-by-day basis, and the degree in a democracy with which Americans do understand these complex issues is a prerequisite for success. Foreign policy no longer has a single or a simple focus, such as defeating Nazi aggression or repelling a monolithic Stalinist threat. Instead, Americans must be mature enough to recognize that we need to be strong and we need to be accommodating at the same time.

For much of this same period, our spending for defense had been going down. If these adverse trends had continued, we would have found ourselves facing a severe military imbalance, an imbalance all the more threatening because of mounting global turbulence.

It would cost our economy about a trillion dollars between now and 1987, and an economic analysis of it shows that there is no way that you can have a Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal intact, make an attempt to balance the budget, keep a strong defense, to which Governor Reagan professes to be committed, and even continue the routine programs that are designed to help the American people have a better life.

The government-subsidized part was showing a reduction in the per capita consumption. And I think it's significant that prior to the Carter administration, under Earl Butz, the support program got down from several billion dollars to only about $600 million, and net farm increase in the country increased by 16 percent.

I think that as long as—I think the whole budget policy, let me answer it this way: The whole budget policy of the Federal Government is a kind of a Rube Goldberg thing that doesn't make as much sense as it does in any State in the Union, and that is, it's called the President's budget. But about 80 percent of it is mandated on the President by actions of Congress. And then the President sends over a suggested budget, and the Congress, with no regard for what the estimated revenues are going to be in the coming year, does whatever they want to do to it.

As Governor of California, it was called the Governor's budget. Every year a group of experts from the private sector and government met and estimated the revenues. And over 25 years of this custom in California, that group never missed by more than 1 percent their estimate of what the revenues would be in the coming year, and then that 1 percent was on estimating them too low.

It does not allow illegal acts by police. What it does is, it provides a good faith rule. Many times a police officer has to make a decision in 30 seconds, or at least in 5 minutes at the most, on whether he will make a search or a stop or something like that. And he does it under all the applicable law at that time. Two years later, by a 4-3 decision in a State court or a 5-4 decision of the United States Supreme Court, they decide that he was wrong, and they change the law. And it applies retroactively to what that officer did. So, what we're suggesting is that a rule of reason be established to say that if the officer was acting in good faith under the applicable laws of that time, then he should not be penalized and the evidence should not be excluded against an obviously guilty person.",0,"-","-","-","-"

But then, in the racial prejudice of the times in areas in the United States, she had to walk about 1/2 mile beyond that school to go to the school that she was permitted to go to. And on cold and wet days and so forth, she told of crying in this long walk when the school was right next door. So, she—the Brown decision—she started this fight after she grew up so that her little girl wouldn't have to do this. And not too long ago, she said, """"What I didn't have in mind is that my little girl now is picked up in a bus and taken past the school near our home and taken to a school several miles away.""""

As you know, General Secretary Gorbachev and I were to have concluded our talks at noon, after more than 7 1/2 hours of meetings over the last 2 days. But when the hour for departure arrived, we both felt that further discussions would be valuable. So, I called Nancy and told her I wouldn't be home for dinner.

We spoke about arms control, human rights, and regional conflicts. And of course, Mr. Gorbachev and I were frank about our disagreements. We had to be. In several critical areas, we made more progress than we anticipated when we came to Iceland. We moved toward agreement on drastically reduced numbers of intermediate-range nuclear missiles in both Europe and Asia. We approached agreement on sharply reduced strategic arsenals for both our countries. We made progress in the area of nuclear testing.

This, we could not and will not do. So, late this afternoon, I made to the General Secretary an entirely new proposal: a 10-year delay in deployment of SDI in exchange for the complete elimination of all ballistic missiles from the respective arsenals of both nations. So long as both the United States and the Soviet Union prove their good faith by destroying nuclear missiles year by year, we would not deploy SDI.

Early in the war, German U-boats began to exact a devastating toll, including the shipping that supplied the British people with food from the United States. Between March and December 1941 the Germans sank ships, totaling more than a million tons. Churchill watched with growing disquiet as his nation was pushed closer and closer to starvation. In April of 1941 the British established bases on this island for escort groups and aircraft. In July we joined them, with the consent of the Icelandic authorities, with bases of our own. These operations, staged from this very island, proved decisive in the balance of the entire struggle.

The story has to do with saluting. I was a second lieutenant of horse cavalry back in the World War II days. As I told the admiral, I wound up flying a desk for the Army Air Force. And so, I know all the rules about not saluting in civilian clothes and so forth, and when you should or shouldn't. But then when I got this job- [laughter] —and I would be approaching Air Force One or Marine One and those marines would come to a salute and I—knowing that I am in civilian clothes—I would nod and say hello and think they could drop their hand, and they wouldn't. They just stood there. So, one night over at the Commandant's quarters, Marine Commandant's quarters in Washington, and I was getting a couple of highballs, and I didn't— [laughter] —know what to do with them. So, I said to the Commandant—I said, """"Look, I know all the rules about saluting in civilian clothes and all, but if I am the Commander in Chief, there ought to be a regulation that would permit me to return a salute.""""

And we've made progress in all of our meetings on all of these subjects. And so, I'm looking forward to the summit.

In this regard, the work of the council has been notable and much needed.

And this election comes, too, after one of the most crucial and significant years in the history of that foreign policy.

Even in the few weeks since I spoke to the General Assembly, we've seen this progress continue in settling regional conflicts in places like Angola, Cambodia, Afghanistan, the Persian Gulf, and elsewhere; regional conflicts once thought impossible to resolve. And so, too, the INF treaty has taken force. We've seen Russian and American missiles—once growing in number and ready to wreak destruction on a massive scale—themselves destroyed in the Russian and American heartland.

Far to the contrary, it was understanding—not misunderstanding-that was the root cause. And I speak here of the clear consensus that developed in the West shortly after World War II on several vital points: the true nature of the Soviet regime, the fundamental distinction between totalitarianism and democracy, and the moral duty to resist the international threat to human rights posed by Soviet expansionism. It was these realities, not some unfortunate or avoidable misunderstanding, that caused East-West tension. And we can forget this lesson only at the greatest peril.",0,"-","-","-","-"

And if there are any who doubt the immensity of the change that has come upon us in 8 years, perhaps they should seek out ethnic Americans and ask their opinion. Ask Polish- or Hungarian-Americans—ask Estonian-, Latvian-, or Lithuanian-Americans if it doesn't mean something when relatives in the old country can at last worship in a long-shutdown cathedral or negotiate working conditions in a shipyard.

I'm instead brought back to a story of my Hollywood days by scriptwriter Tom Mankiewicz, who described the time his producer walked through the door of his office and asked him what he had planned for the film's archvillain, Blofield. And Mankiewicz very proudly told the producer, """"Blofield is going to threaten to blow up the world.""""

Look at Poland, where Solidarity, Solidarnosc, and the Catholic Church have won legal status. The forces of freedom are putting the Soviet status quo on the defensive.

It can only end when Europe is whole. Today it is this very concept of a divided Europe that is under siege. And that's why our hopes run especially high, because the division of Europe is under siege not by armies but by the spread of ideas that began here, right here. It was a son of Mainz, Johannes Gutenberg, who liberated the mind of man through the power of the printed word. And that same liberating power is unleashed today in a hundred new forms. The Voice of America, Deutsche Welle, allow us to enlighten millions deep within Eastern Europe and throughout the world. Television satellites allow us to bear witness from the shipyards of Gdansk to Tiananmen Square. But the momentum for freedom does not just come from the printed word or the transistor or the television screen; it comes from a single powerful idea: democracy.",0,"-","-","-","-"

This one idea is why the Communist world, from Budapest to Beijing, is in ferment. Of course, for the leaders of the East, it's not just freedom for freedom's sake.

Since much remains to be done in both East and West, we ask Eastern Europe to join us in this common struggle.

We've always believed that a strong Western defense is the best road to peace. Forty years of experience have proven us right. But we've done more than just keep the peace. By standing together, we have convinced the Soviets that their arms buildup has been costly and pointless. Let us not give them incentives to return to the policies of the past.

1345,"1345_28","Remarks to the Citizens in Mainz, Federal Republic of Germany","George Bush","May 31, 1989","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","Our proposal has several key initiatives. I propose that we lock in the Eastern agreement to Western-proposed ceilings on tanks and armored troop carriers.

This reduction to parity, a fair and balanced level of strength, would compel the Soviets to reduce their 600,000-strong Red Army in Eastern Europe by 325,000.

And therefore, I want to reiterate my support for greater transparency. I renew my proposal that the Soviet Union and its allies open their skies to reciprocal, unarmed aerial surveillance flights, conducted on short notice, to watch military activities. Satellites are a very important way to verify arms control agreements, but they do not provide constant coverage of the Soviet Union.

In the report he reviewed his efforts since November 1992, explained in detail the confidence-building package that he had proposed, including his proposals for Varosha and the Nicosia International Airport, and provided observations on the current state of the negotiations. The gist of those paragraphs is that: (paragraph 45) all concerned have a special responsibility to bring to a positive conclusion an effort that has already produced """"significant progress""""; (paragraph 46) the Secretary General was particularly gratified that the preparations in Nicosia for the May 24 New York negotiating session had brought his confidence-building proposals to an advanced stage; (paragraph 47) the Varosha/Nicosia International Airport proposals would bring considerable and proportionate benefits to both Cypriot communities; (paragraph 48) beyond the economic gains to both sides, the package would open avenues of contact between the communities and engender the kind of goodwill that should exist in a federation; (paragraph 49) the Secretary General is disappointed that, despite his assurances of June 1, Mr. Denktash neither promoted the acceptance of the package during his consultations in Nicosia and Ankara, nor did he honor his agreement to return to New York on June 14; (paragraph 50) the Secretary General hopes that the merits of the package will commend themselves to all concerned once they have been fully presented; and (paragraph 51) the Secretary General intends to continue his efforts and, to that end, has asked his Special Representative (Mr. Clark) to visit Cyprus, Greece, and Turkey in the following few weeks. The Secretary General also attached, as an annex to his report, a list of the confidence-building measures that his representatives had proposed to the two sides (including the Varosha/Nicosia International Airport proposals, which were detailed in the body of the report).",0,"-","-","-","-"

I think that in the last election, a lot of people who are not friendly to some of his policies did very well, partly because the reformers didn't campaign as one group and didn't do a very good job in the mass media and all that sort of stuff, partly because the average Russian's having a tough time now. One of the things that I did when I was in Russia, and you know, through that town meeting—kind of like we do—and let people ask me questions, and I tried to establish some link between them and these processes of reform that are sweeping the world. Because times are tough for them now. And I think anytime times are tough—and keep in mind, they've just been a democracy a little while. We've been at this 200 years. And we kind of feel haywire from time to time, and we've been working at it for two centuries. They just got started. And so they elected some pretty extremist people and some people that are calling them to a past that is romanticized. And I think he's going to have a challenging time.

We've now been a full year, and as you know, we've got a few more months to go before we withdraw our troops. But the thing that caused the starvation in Somalia in the beginning was that a lot of people identified with their clans more than the country as a whole, and they were fighting each other. What we have done is to set in motion a process in which the clans can agree to a peaceable way of governing the country among themselves. And if they don't do that, we'd have to stay forever. And we can't do that. So in the end, the people of Somalia are going to have to take responsibility for themselves and their future.

First of all, we've got to strengthen our law enforcement forces. You've got a great new mayor in Detroit in Dennis Archer. He's a longtime friend of mine. I read his inaugural address the other day. It was a brilliant way of getting Detroit together and getting started. But we have to put more police officers on the street, well-trained and working with people in the communities, walking the blocks, working with the kids, preventing crime as well as catching criminals. Our crime bill will put 100,000 more police officers on the street. It's the first priority for Congress when they come back.",0,"-","-","-","-"

1596,"1596_170","Interview With Larry King","William J. Clinton","January 20, 1994","Press, Interviews, Presidential","And fourthly, you've got to give these kids something to say """"yes"""" to. That is, we have got to go into these really distressed areas and rebuild the bonds of family, community, and work. There's got to be education opportunities. There's got to be job opportunities. There's got to be alternatives to imprisonment, like boot camps. There needs to be drug treatment and drug education programs. We can't have it all on the punishment. These children have to have something to say yes to. If you look at a lot of these high crime areas where the gangs and the drugs and the guns are, they fill the vacuum when family collapses, when work collapses. Most of us organize our lives around work, family, community. And a lot of these young people that are in real trouble today and really vulnerable are living in places where there's not enough community, enough family, or enough work. So I think we have to do both things. And then next year or this year now, I'm going to ask the Congress to work with me and then work with the mayors, the Governors, and others to really get serious about this. We've got to do something about it, and we've got a program that will make a difference.",0,"-","-","-","-"

He said what he thought; I said what I thought. And maybe most important, we agreed that our Secretary of State, Warren Christopher, and their Foreign Minister, Mr. Shara, would meet and really try to get beyond the charges to very specific things, that we would come forward with specific instances of things that we believe have been done that are a violation of international law that cannot be tolerated, and we would try to work through them.

A lot of companies are hiring people on a part-time or temporary basis because they don't want to give them benefits. Under your health care plan, how will people who work part-time or freelance have their benefits paid for?",0,"-","-","-","-"
1596,"1596_186","Interview With Larry King","William J. Clinton","January 20, 1994","Press, Interviews, Presidential","The President. That's a great question. Let me answer the question and make a general point. First of all, under our health care plan, part-time workers will be covered partly by their employers if they work more than 10 hours a week. They will pay a portion of their premiums. And then the rest of the premium will be paid for out of a Government fund set up for that purpose. But part-time workers will be covered, and their employers will have to pay something for their coverage, too. I think that's only fair. Also, if we can do something to slow the dramatic increase in the cost of health care and to make sure all workers are covered, that, I think, will help to stabilize this trend, and more and more employers will be willing to hire new workers on a full-time basis.",0,"-","-","-","-"
1596,"1596_187","Interview With Larry King","William J. Clinton","January 20, 1994","Press, Interviews, Presidential","And let me say, we're beginning to see that now. Since I became President and we got serious about bringing the deficit down, bringing interest rates down, getting investment up, and employment started coming again, as confidence gets back into this economy, then employers will be able to hire more full-time workers. Then this year, what I have to be able to do is to show the business community that this health care plan of ours is going to stabilize health care costs while providing health care for all Americans through a guaranteed private insurance system, not a Government system but a private system. But we have to ask the employers to pay something for their part-time workers, too. I think that's only fair.",0,"-","-","-","-"

We are now involved in intense negotiations, and the only thing I can tell you is we're working as hard as we can to be as firm as we can and then to be as also as firm as we can about the security of our people and the South Koreans in the event all does not go well.

First of all, don't forget what we have done. We have led the longest airlift in history, now longer than the Berlin airlift, to give food and medicine to the people there. Secondly, we have enforced a ferocious embargo which has cost the Serbs, in particular, dearly. It has virtually wrecked the Serbian economy. They continue to fight, but they have paid a terrible price for it economically. And thirdly, we have tried to work with our allies at NATO to say that we would use air power if Sarajevo were subject to shelling and strangulation again. And finally, we're supporting the peace process. I hope the parties will agree. You see, the Serbs and the Croats have agreed now. The government had been losing on the ground. They'd been making some gains so they've not agreed to any peace—or they're going to have to give, I think, to Moslems, some access to the water in order to get a peace agreement.

Rather than limiting the spread of weapons of mass destruction, it would limit the prospect for future cooperation in this area. Rather than bringing stability to the region, it would increase instability, as the leaders of Hong Kong, Taiwan, and all the nations of the region have stated repeatedly.

The House has spoken overwhelmingly on the age increase. The problem I have with the age increase is that one of the biggest difficulties we have today with Americans without health insurance are people who retire early at 55 and lose their employerbased health insurance and then, because they've had—they've been somewhat ill or had problems, can't get other health insurance until they qualify for Medicare. So if we're going to raise the age limit, we need to have some idea of how those people would be insured. And I don't know that we do now. That's been my problem with that.",0,"-","-","-","-"

It seemed to me that the country had to make a number of changes if we were going to go into the next century with the American dream alive for everyone, leading the world in all the ways that are so important, and giving our children the future they deserve. And I felt, among other things, that our party, which has historically been the progressive party, had to advocate changes that would move beyond the old divisions between growing the economy, preserving the environment, helping business, helping labor, being tough on crime, being compassionate and smart—all those what I have always thought were kind of false choices. And that we ought to have a simple strategy that asks, will this create opportunity for people who are responsible enough to work for it? Will this bring us together, rather than drive us apart? Will this preserve our leadership for peace and freedom and prosperity? That's what we've tried to do.",0,"-","-","-","-"

1934,"1934_5","Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Dinner","William J.

But it's important to note that 80 percent of the tax relief went to the children's tax credit for middle income people, to the education tax credits to open the doors of college education to all who are willing to work for it, and to the initiatives primarily directed at urban America, to the areas which have not participated in our recovery—80 percent.",0,"-","-","-","-"

Our economic analyses are that one full fourth, 25 percent of the economic growth this country has had in the last 4 1/2 years, which is now 13 million new jobs, a fourth came directly from the efforts to open markets to American products and services.

1934,"1934_11","Remarks at a Democratic National Committee Dinner","William J.

That is an absolutely critical thing. Unless we change the cost environment, no matter how you work with, manipulate, or change the contribution rules, there will still be the costs out there and they will flow somehow, because people will have to communicate with the voters and will have to be able to reach the voters with a message.",0,"-","-","-","-"

In December in Japan, the advanced nations of the world— and we hope all the others—will be called upon to make commitments to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions of our economy so that we can reduce the rate at which the planet is warming up. This is a big deal. If we have just a few degrees of warming of the planet over the next hundred years, it could lead to rises in the sea levels which could, for example, flood the entire Florida Everglades. It could change the whole economic structure of American agriculture. So we have to find a way to grow the economy and improve the environment.",0,"-","-","-","-"

That's really the issue. Social Security right now is secure through 2029. We just added 10 more years to the Medicare Trust Fund. The issue is, how can we preserve the integrity of these programs and the benefits they bring in a century when people are going to be living longer and when the baby boomers will retire and there will be just barely more than two people working for every person retired. We've never dealt with an issue like this without a crisis before, but the bottom line is, if we make modest changes now, we can avoid imposing drastic changes that our children will have to make later. I think the responsible thing to do is to deal with the modest changes now. So I hope we will do that.",0,"-","-","-","-"

I am still—I think """"obsessed"""" is not too strong a word—with the challenges so many Americans face succeeding in raising their children and succeeding at work. And there is still not a systematic network of child care out there. We have gotten a lot of help from the Congress in establishing child care networks for people who will be moving from welfare to work, and that's good. But there are a lot of people who have never been on welfare who work for modest wages, whose children simply do not have access to quality, affordable child care.

One of the things we have pushed very hard for is the adherence of the Chinese Government to the U.N. Convention on Civil and Political Rights, which President Jiang has said he will sign in the fall, in September or October which, as you know, will among other things require China to begin to admit on a regular basis international observers to talk to citizens, including political dissidents, on a regular basis to try to make sure that they are not abused in the practice of their civil and political rights and that they begin to be integrated into the mainstream of society.",0,"-","-","-","-"

I do believe, as I told President Jiang when he was here, that free political speech and expression is plainly a precondition for any modern state.

I don't think America is weakened because every day someone takes the floor of Congress and criticizes me; every day someone writes an editorial and criticizes me; every day there are— I just don't believe that. I think that—and of course all liberty, any freedom—let me say this—any freedom granted across the board is bound to be abused from time to time.

Well, I think it is—first of all, let me say at this particular moment I don't feel free to say everything I'm going to say to President Jiang because of some of the sensitive work I've been doing on this issue for the last several weeks. But again I would say my general point is, not just to President Jiang but to the other influential members of the Chinese Government: Forget about our difference over what's right and wrong; we think it's wrong to deny the Dalai Lama access to his people in Tibet; we think it's wrong for the people of Tibet to be subject to any sort of religious, cultural, or economic discrimination.",0,"-","-","-","-"

And the Tibetan Buddhism as a religious faith, as a culture and a way of life, the ability of the Tibetan people to be free of any kind of economic or other handicaps and the signal it would send to the rest of the world about China's attitude about human dignity and diversity and difference of religion, race, and opinion—the gains to China from doing this would far outweigh any marginal extra tension they might feel about the long-term future of Tibet in this context.",0,"-","-","-","-"

They don't see it that way because they continue to believe that the only— that it's just one step to losing part of China. I think it's important for Americans to understand that—this is something that I've learned not just in dealing with China but in dealing with all other countries. Countries are like people; they have a collective memory.

Therefore, to an outsider who knows nothing of China's history, the importance to China, which is so large and so big, of the """"one China"""" policy vis-a-vis Taiwan, of getting back Hong Kong, of making sure that nothing could ever happen and Tibet—to promote any separatism.

We don't know the facts of the case, and none of us should comment on them or prejudge anyone. But the indications are that he was beaten so badly because he was gay, by people who were either full of hatred or full of fear or both. And yet if you think about it, the thing that's special about America is that we're supposed to create a place for every law-abiding citizen in this country, no matter how different we all are, one from another—by race, by religion, by circumstance, by neighborhood—no matter what.",0,"-","-","-","-"

We project that we will average big surpluses over the next 25 years. I recommend that for 15 of those 25 years, we actually save almost 80 percent of the surplus and save it because when the baby boomers become the senior boom when we all retire, there will only be about two people working for every one person drawing Social Security.""""",0,"-","-","-","-"

2048,"2048_38","Remarks on Presenting the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards","William J.

And so what I propose to do is to save this portion of the surplus, about a little over 60 percent for Social Security, 15 percent for Medicare for 15 years, and while we're doing it, to buy back the public debt with the money we're saving, because we don't need to spend it right now.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2048,"2048_39","Remarks on Presenting the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards","William J.

But I'd like to tell you why it's important. We just presented a budget to Congress. Before we do anything with that budget, we have to pay interest on the national debt. The national debt quadrupled between 1981 and 1993. When I took office, it was taking over 14 cents of every dollar just to pay interest. Every time you pay a dollar in tax to the Federal Government, before we can spend it on the United States military— including the Army Band who were magnificent today—before we can spend it on education, before we can spend it on the environment, before we can spend it on health care, before we can spend it on a tax cut, before we can do anything with it, we had to take over 14 cents on the dollar and pay interest on the debt. And they told me, my economists, that it wouldn't be anytime until we'd be up to over 20 cents on the tax dollar in interest.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2048,"2048_41","Remarks on Presenting the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards","William J.

It will be the lowest it's been since 1917, just before we entered World War I. And it will take debt service down to 2 cents on the dollar. And then our successors, the people that are up here running the show 15 years from now, they can do whatever they want with that 11 cents. They can give it back to you in a tax cut. They can invest it in education. They can invest it in whatever else we need. They can make sure we keep modernizing our military. They can do whatever is the right thing then. But I know it is the right thing to prepare for the retirement of the baby boomers and to stabilize these programs and to get this debt down.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2048,"2048_42","Remarks on Presenting the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Awards","William J.

Then if the world takes off again—and we're working for it—we'll do even better.

America has had for many years a budget deficit and an investment deficit. While we have cut the deficit, we've almost doubled our investment in education and training. But 88 percent of the companies—listen to this—88 percent of the companies in manufacturing today are having trouble finding qualified applicants to fill at least one kind of job.

So what I have asked the Congress to do is to pass laws providing tax credits for people who invest in these designated areas, and also setting up a model, sort of like our Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which many of you in this room have used before, to guarantee a portion of investments in an inner city, so that, for example—suppose that in a big urban census area that had a 15-percent unemployment rate, you were willing to go in and set up a plant with 300 people and train them and do all that, and the initial investment was $300 million. If you took full advantage of this proposal of ours, you could have 2 of that $300 million guaranteed in the """"American Private Investment Corporation."""" The other $100 million, you'd get a 25 percent tax credit for the investment. So if we put together $300 million of investment in an underdeveloped area, you would actually have only $75 million at risk. That's a pretty good deal.",0,"-","-","-","-"

I think that Hillary and I have spent more time on Native American issues and with Native American leaders than any previous administration, at least that I know anything about. And with all respect, one of the things that I think is killing us in this country—still is a big problem—is a phenomenal amount of ignorance, on the part not just of schoolchildren but of people in very important positions of decisionmaking, about the real, factual history of the Native Americans in the United States.",0,"-","-","-","-"

I think it doesn't answer all the questions of what should be the details of the resolution between the Israelis and the Palestinians. It doesn't solve all the problems, but everybody should see that this is a good thing. I think that the American Jewish community was maybe the most ardent community, earliest, for the United States stepping forward in Kosovo.

2092,"2092_61","Remarks at the Seventh Millennium Evening at the White House","William J.

And therefore, it is easy for us to be angry and to respond in kind. I think it is important to recognize, however, that Iran, because of its enormous geopolitical importance over time, has been the subject of quite a lot of abuse from various Western nations. And I think sometimes it's quite important to tell people, """"Look, you have a right to be angry at something my country or my culture or others that are generally allied with us today did to you 50 or 60 or 100 or 150 years ago.

2092,"2092_63","Remarks at the Seventh Millennium Evening at the White House","William J.

First of all, I think given the fact that we're living in an age of globalization, where, whether we like it or not, more and more of our economic and cultural and other contacts will cross national lines, it is, in fact, a very good thing that sometime in the next century there will be no single majority racial group.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2092,"2092_66","Remarks at the Seventh Millennium Evening at the White House","William J.

2092,"2092_67","Remarks at the Seventh Millennium Evening at the White House","William J.

But I am convinced that—and I see your colleague, Mr. Silber, out here, who's thought about this a great deal in his life— I'm convinced that lowering standards for people who come from poor backgrounds is not the answer.",0,"-","-","-","-"

Today, as we meet in this international center, though all the world is now a part of this millennial calendar change, we must recognize that for more than half the world, because they are not Christians, the number 2000 has less significance: for Muslims, this is the year 1420; for Hindus, it is 1921; for Buddhists, it is 2543; Mayans honor the year 5119; and the Hebrew calendar marks this year as 5760.",0,"-","-","-","-"

2234,"2234_7","Remarks at the """"Millennium Around the World"""" Celebration","William J.

History shows that people do tend to be afraid of those who don't look the same or practice religion the same way or come from different tribes or have different lifestyles. Those fears, when ignited and organized by unscrupulous leaders, have led to terrible violence in the modern world. Even in the most open societies, including our own, children who learn to look down and dehumanize those who are different and perhaps to blame them for their own problems continue to grow up to commit awful hate crimes.",0,"-","-","-","-"

Now, for the first time in history, more than half the world's people live under governments of their own choosing. Sixty years ago many people thought that nothing could stop dictators from imposing their will on the world through violence. But since then, democratic countries have risen, not just once but time and time again, to defeat fascism, to help nations free themselves from totalitarianism, to help stop racial apartheid and ethnic cleansing, to uphold and advance human rights.

And then there are the new problems: the organized forces of crime, narcotrafficking, terror; governments too weak to handle the sweeping forces of globalization and their impact on their people; ordinary people across the world who have yet to see the benefits of democracy and free enterprise but have borne the burden of the economic and social changes some can delay but none can avoid.",0,"-","-","-","-"

When there's a flood in Venezuela that kills thousands and thousands of innocent people, when we see the plight of young war victims in Sierra Leone who have lost their limbs, when we see hundreds of thousands of people displaced by ethnic cleansing from their homeland in Kosovo, we can choose to do nothing, but we can't pretend we don't know, and we can no longer shield our conscience or our interest from their impact.

It's been more than 7 years since the Taliban was removed from power, yet war rages on and insurgents control parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan.

2724,"2724_6","Remarks on United States Military and Diplomatic Strategies for Afghanistan and Pakistan","Barack Obama","March 27, 2009","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","So let me be clear: Al Qaida and its allies, the terrorists who planned and supported the 9/11 attacks, are in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Multiple intelligence estimates have warned that Al Qaida is actively planning attacks on the United States homeland from its safe haven in Pakistan. And if the Afghan Government falls to the Taliban or allows Al Qaida to go unchallenged, that country will again be a base for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they possibly can.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2724,"2724_7","Remarks on United States Military and Diplomatic Strategies for Afghanistan and Pakistan","Barack Obama","March 27, 2009","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","The future of Afghanistan is inextricably linked to the future of its neighbor Pakistan. In the nearly 8 years since 9/11, Al Qaida and its extremist allies have moved across the border to the remote areas of the Pakistani frontier. This almost certainly includes Al Qaida's leadership, Usama bin Laden and Ayman Al-Zawahiri. They have used this mountainous terrain as a safe haven to hide, to train terrorists, to communicate with followers, to plot attacks, and to send fighters to support the insurgency in Afghanistan. For the American people, this border region has become the most dangerous place in the world.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2724,"2724_8","Remarks on United States Military and Diplomatic Strategies for Afghanistan and Pakistan","Barack Obama","March 27, 2009","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","But this is not simply an American problem--far from it--it is, instead, an international security challenge of the highest order. Terrorist attacks in London and Bali were tied to Al Qaida and its allies in Pakistan, as were attacks in North Africa and the Middle East, in Islamabad and in Kabul. If there is a major attack on an Asian, European, or African city, it too is likely to have ties to Al Qaida's leadership in Pakistan. The safety of people around the world is at stake.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2724,"2724_9","Remarks on United States Military and Diplomatic Strategies for Afghanistan and Pakistan","Barack Obama","March 27, 2009","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","For the Afghan people, a return to Taliban rule would condemn their country to brutal governance, international isolation, a paralyzed economy, and the denial of basic human rights to the Afghan people, especially women and girls. The return in force of Al Qaida terrorists who would accompany the core Taliban leadership would cast Afghanistan under the shadow of perpetual violence.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2724,"2724_10","Remarks on United States Military and Diplomatic Strategies for Afghanistan and Pakistan","Barack Obama","March 27, 2009","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","As President, my greatest responsibility is to protect the American people.

2724,"2724_11","Remarks on United States Military and Diplomatic Strategies for Afghanistan and Pakistan","Barack Obama","March 27, 2009","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","So I want the American people to understand that we have a clear and focused goal to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat Al Qaida in Pakistan and Afghanistan and to prevent their return to either country in the future. That's the goal that must be achieved; that is a cause that could not be more just. And to the terrorists who oppose us, my message is the same: We will defeat you.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2724,"2724_12","Remarks on United States Military and Diplomatic Strategies for Afghanistan and Pakistan","Barack Obama","March 27, 2009","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","To achieve our goals, we need a stronger, smarter, and comprehensive strategy. To focus on the greatest threat to our people, America must no longer deny resources to Afghanistan because of the war in Iraq. To enhance the military, governance, and economic capacity of Afghanistan and Pakistan, we have to marshal international support. And to defeat an enemy that heeds no borders or laws of war, we must recognize the fundamental connection between the future of Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is why I've appointed Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, who is here, to serve as Special Representative for both countries and to work closely with General Petraeus to integrate our civilian and military efforts.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2724,"2724_13","Remarks on United States Military and Diplomatic Strategies for Afghanistan and Pakistan","Barack Obama","March 27, 2009","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","Let me start by addressing the way forward in Pakistan. The United States has great respect for the Pakistani people. They have a rich history and have struggled against long odds to sustain their democracy. The people of Pakistan want the same things that we want: an end to terror, access to basic services, the opportunity to live their dreams, and the security that can only come with the rule of law. The single greatest threat to that future comes from Al Qaida and their extremist allies, and that is why we must stand together.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2724,"2724_14","Remarks on United States Military and Diplomatic Strategies for Afghanistan and Pakistan","Barack Obama","March 27, 2009","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","The terrorists within Pakistan's borders are not simply enemies of America or Afghanistan, they are a grave and urgent danger to the people of Pakistan. Al Qaida and other violent extremists have killed several thousand Pakistanis since 9/11. They've killed many Pakistani soldiers and police. They assassinated Benazir Bhutto. They've blown up buildings, derailed foreign investment, and threatened the stability of the state. So make no mistake: Al Qaida and its extremist allies are a cancer that risks killing Pakistan from within.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2724,"2724_15","Remarks on United States Military and Diplomatic Strategies for Afghanistan and Pakistan","Barack Obama","March 27, 2009","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","It's important for the American people to understand that Pakistan needs our help in going after Al Qaida. This is no simple task. The tribal regions are vast, they are rugged, and they are often ungoverned. And that's why we must focus our military assistance on the tools, training, and support that Pakistan needs to root out the terrorists. And after years of mixed results, we will not, and cannot, provide a blank check. Pakistan must demonstrate its commitment to rooting out Al Qaida and the violent extremists within its borders. And we will insist that action be taken, one way or another, when we have intelligence about high-level terrorist targets.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2724,"2724_16","Remarks on United States Military and Diplomatic Strategies for Afghanistan and Pakistan","Barack Obama","March 27, 2009","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","The Government's ability to destroy these safe havens is tied to its own strength and security. To help Pakistan weather the economic crisis, we must continue to work with the IMF, the World Bank, and other international partners. To lessen tensions between two nuclear-armed nations that too often teeter on the edge of escalation and confrontation, we must pursue constructive diplomacy with both India and Pakistan. To avoid the mistakes of the past, we must make clear that our relationship with Pakistan is grounded in support for Pakistan's democratic institutions and the Pakistani people. And to demonstrate through deeds as well as words a commitment that is enduring, we must stand for lasting opportunity.",0,"-","-","-","-"

Al Qaidas offers the people of Pakistan nothing but destruction. We stand for something different. So today I am calling upon Congress to pass a bipartisan bill cosponsored by John Kerry and Richard Lugar that authorizes $1.5 billion in direct support to the Pakistani people every year over the next 5 years, resources that will build schools and roads and hospitals and strengthen Pakistan's democracy. I'm also calling on Congress to pass a bipartisan bill cosponsored by Maria Cantwell, Chris Van Hollen, and Peter Hoekstra that creates opportunity zones in the border regions to develop the economy and bring hope to places plagued with violence. And we will ask our friends and allies to do their part, including at the donors conference in Tokyo next month.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2724,"2724_18","Remarks on United States Military and Diplomatic Strategies for Afghanistan and Pakistan","Barack Obama","March 27, 2009","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","I don't ask for this support lightly. These are challenging times; resources are stretched. But the American people must understand that this is a downpayment on our own future, because the security of America and Pakistan is shared. Pakistan's Government must be a stronger partner in destroying these safe havens, and we must isolate Al Qaida from the Pakistani people. And these steps in Pakistan are also indispensable to our efforts in Afghanistan, which will see no end to violence if insurgents move freely back and forth across the border.",0,"-","-","-","-"

2724,"2724_23","Remarks on United States Military and Diplomatic Strategies for Afghanistan and Pakistan","Barack Obama","March 27, 2009","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","At the same time, we will shift the emphasis of our mission to training and increasing the size of Afghan security forces, so that they can eventually take the lead in securing their country.

And those resources have been denied because of the war in Iraq. Now, that will change. The additional troops that we deployed have already increased our training capacity. And later this spring, we will deploy approximately 4,000 U.S. troops to train Afghan security forces. For the first time, this will truly resource our effort to train and support the Afghan Army and police. Every American unit in Afghanistan will be partnered with an Afghan unit, and we will seek additional trainers from our NATO allies to ensure that every Afghan unit has a coalition partner. We will accelerate our efforts to build an Afghan Army of 134,000 and a police force of 82,000 so that we can meet these goals by 2011, and increases in Afghan forces may very well be needed as our plans to turn over security responsibility to the Afghans go forward.",1,"-","-","-","-"
2724,"2724_25","Remarks on United States Military and Diplomatic Strategies for Afghanistan and Pakistan","Barack Obama","March 27, 2009","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","This push must be joined by a dramatic increase in our civilian effort. Afghanistan has an elected government, but it is undermined by corruption and has difficulty delivering basic services to its people. The economy is undercut by a booming narcotics trade that encourages criminality and funds the insurgency. The people of Afghanistan seek the promise of a better future.

That's how we can help the Afghan Government serve its people and develop an economy that isn't dominated by illicit drugs. And that's why I'm ordering a substantial increase in our civilians on the ground.

But make no mistake: Our efforts will fail in Afghanistan and Pakistan if we don't invest in their future. And that's why my budget includes indispensable investments in our State Department and foreign assistance programs. These investments relieve the burden on our troops. They contribute directly to security. They make the American people safer. And they save us an enormous amount of money in the long run, because it's far cheaper to train a policeman to secure his or her own village than to help a farmer seed a crop--or to help a farmer seed a crop than it is to send our troops to fight tour after tour of duty with no transition to Afghan responsibility.",0,"-","-","-","-"

So my budget will increase funding for a strong Inspector General at both State Department and USAID and include robust funding for the Special Inspector Generals for Afghan Reconstruction. And I want to be clear: We cannot turn a blind eye to the corruption that causes Afghans to lose faith in their own leaders. Instead, we will seek a new compact with the Afghan Government that cracks down on corrupt behavior and sets clear benchmarks, clear metrics for international assistance so that it is used to provide for the needs of the Afghan people.",0,"-","-","-","-"

The world cannot afford the price that will come due if Afghanistan slides back into chaos or Al Qaida operates unchecked. We have a shared responsibility to act, not because we seek to project power for its own sake, but because our own peace and security depends on it. And what's at stake at this time is not just our own security, it's the very idea that free nations can come together on behalf of our common security.

We have consistently talked about the need for health care reform because family premiums are going up three times faster than inflation and wages. The costs of Medicare and Medicaid will bankrupt this country if we don't reduce the cost inflation of health care.

Now, let me be clear: There has never been an option before me that called for troop deployments before 2010, so there has been no delay or denial of resources necessary for the conduct of the war during this review period. Instead, the review has allowed me to ask the hard questions and to explore all the different options, along with my national security team, our military and civilian leadership in Afghanistan, and our key partners. And given the stakes involved, I owed the American people and our troops no less.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2762,"2762_14","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","This review is now complete. And as Commander in Chief, I have determined that it is in our vital national interest to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. After 18 months, our troops will begin to come home. These are the resources that we need to seize the initiative, while building the Afghan capacity that can allow for a responsible transition of our forces out of Afghanistan.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2762,"2762_15","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","I do not make this decision lightly. I opposed the war in Iraq precisely because I believe that we must exercise restraint in the use of military force and always consider the long-term consequences of our actions. We have been at war now for 8 years, at enormous cost in lives and resources. Years of debate over Iraq and terrorism have left our unity on national security issues in tatters and created a highly polarized and partisan backdrop for this effort. And having just experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, the American people are understandably focused on rebuilding our economy and putting people to work here at home.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2762,"2762_16","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","Most of all, I know that this decision asks even more of you, a military that, along with your families, has already borne the heaviest of all burdens. As President, I have signed a letter of condolence to the family of each American who gives their life in these wars. I have read the letters from the parents and spouses of those who deployed. I've visited our courageous wounded warriors at Walter Reed. I've traveled to Dover to meet the flag-draped caskets of 18 Americans returning home to their final resting place. I see firsthand the terrible wages of war. If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of the American people were at stake in Afghanistan, I would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2762,"2762_17","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","So no, I do not make this decision lightly. I make this decision because I am convinced that our security is at stake in Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is the epicenter of violent extremism practiced by Al Qaida. It is from here that we were attacked on 9/11, and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak. This is no idle danger, no hypothetical threat. In the last few months alone, we have apprehended extremists within our borders who were sent here from the border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan to commit new acts of terror. And this danger will only grow if the region slides backwards and Al Qaida can operate with impunity. We must keep the pressure on Al Qaida, and to do that, we must increase the stability and capacity of our partners in the region.",0,"-","-","-","-"

This is not just America's war. Since 9/11, Al Qaida's safe havens have been the source of attacks against London and Amman and Bali. The people and Governments of both Afghanistan and Pakistan are endangered. And the stakes are even higher within a nuclear-armed Pakistan, because we know that Al Qaida and other extremists seek nuclear weapons, and we have every reason to believe that they would use them.",0,"-","-","-","-"

2762,"2762_20","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","To meet that goal, we will pursue the following objectives within Afghanistan.

2762,"2762_23","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","Because this is an international effort, I've asked that our commitment be joined by contributions from our allies. Some have already provided additional troops, and we're confident that there will be further contributions in the days and weeks ahead. Our friends have fought and bled and died alongside us in Afghanistan. And now we must come together to end this war successfully, for what's at stake is not simply a test of NATO's credibility, what's at stake is the security of our allies and the common security of the world.",1,"-","-","-","-"

Just as we have done in Iraq, we will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground. We'll continue to advise and assist Afghanistan's security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul.

2762,"2762_25","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","Second, we will work with our partners, the United Nations, and the Afghan people to pursue a more effective civilian strategy so that the Government can take advantage of improved security. This effort must be based on performance. The days of providing a blank check are over. President Karzai's inauguration speech sent the right message about moving in a new direction. And going forward, we will be clear about what we expect from those who receive our assistance. We'll support Afghan ministries, Governors, and local leaders that combat corruption and deliver for the people. We expect those who are ineffective or corrupt to be held accountable.

So tonight I want the Afghan people to understand: America seeks an end to this era of war and suffering. We have no interest in occupying your country. We will support efforts by the Afghan Government to open the door to those Taliban who abandon violence and respect the human rights of their fellow citizens. And we will seek a partnership with Afghanistan, grounded in mutual respect, to isolate those who destroy, to strengthen those who build, to hasten the day when our troops will leave, and to forge a lasting friendship in which America is your partner and never your patron.",0,"-","-","-","-"

But in recent years, as innocents have been killed from Karachi to Islamabad, it has become clear that it is the Pakistani people who are the most endangered by extremism. Public opinion has turned. The Pakistani Army has waged an offensive in Swat and South Waziristan. And there is no doubt that the United States and Pakistan share a common enemy.",0,"-","-","-","-"

We will strengthen Pakistan's capacity to target those groups that threaten our countries and have made it clear that we cannot tolerate a safe haven for terrorists whose location is known and whose intentions are clear. America is also providing substantial resources to support Pakistan's democracy and development. We are the largest international supporter for those Pakistanis displaced by the fighting.

2762,"2762_31","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","I recognize there are a range of concerns about our approach. So let me briefly address a few of the more prominent arguments that I've heard and which I take very seriously.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2762,"2762_32","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","First, there are those who suggest that Afghanistan is another Vietnam. They argue that it cannot be stabilized and we're better off cutting our losses and rapidly withdrawing. I believe this argument depends on a false reading of history. Unlike Vietnam, we are joined by a broad coalition of 43 nations that recognizes the legitimacy of our action. Unlike Vietnam, we are not facing a broad-based popular insurgency. And most importantly, unlike Vietnam, the American people were viciously attacked from Afghanistan and remain a target for those same extremists who are plotting along its border. To abandon this area now and to rely only on efforts against Al Qaida from a distance would significantly hamper our ability to keep the pressure on Al Qaida and create an unacceptable risk of additional attacks on our homeland and our allies.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2762,"2762_33","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","Second, there are those who acknowledge that we can't leave Afghanistan in its current state, but suggest that we go forward with the troops that we already have. But this would simply maintain a status quo in which we muddle through and permit a slow deterioration of conditions there. It would ultimately prove more costly and prolong our stay in Afghanistan, because we would never be able to generate the conditions needed to train Afghan security forces and give them the space to take over.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2762,"2762_34","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","Finally, there are those who oppose identifying a timeframe for our transition to Afghan responsibility. Indeed, some call for a more dramatic and open-ended escalation of our war effort, one that would commit us to a nation-building project of up to a decade. I reject this course because it sets goals that are beyond what can be achieved at a reasonable cost and what we need to achieve to secure our interests. Furthermore, the absence of a timeframe for transition would deny us any sense of urgency in working with the Afghan Government. It must be clear that Afghans will have to take responsibility for their security and that America has no interest in fighting an endless war in Afghanistan.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2762,"2762_35","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","As President, I refuse to set goals that go beyond our responsibility, our means, or our interests. And I must weigh all of the challenges that our Nation faces. I don't have the luxury of committing to just one. Indeed, I'm mindful of the words of President Eisenhower, who, in discussing our national security, said, """"Each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs.""""",0,"-","-","-","-"
2762,"2762_36","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","Over the past several years, we have lost that balance. We've failed to appreciate the connection between our national security and our economy. In the wake of an economic crisis, too many of our neighbors and friends are out of work and struggle to pay the bills. Too many Americans are worried about the future facing our children. Meanwhile, competition within the global economy has grown more fierce. So we can't simply afford to ignore the price of these wars.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2762,"2762_37","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","All told, by the time I took office, the cost of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan approached a trillion dollars. And going forward, I am committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly. Our new approach in Afghanistan is likely to cost us roughly $30 billion for the military this year, and I'll work closely with Congress to address these costs as we work to bring down our deficit.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2762,"2762_38","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","But as we end the war in Iraq and transition to Afghan responsibility, we must rebuild our strength here at home. Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power. It pays for our military. It underwrites our diplomacy. It taps the potential of our people and allows investment in new industry. And it will allow us to compete in this century as successfully as we did in the last. That's why our troop commitment in Afghanistan cannot be open ended, because the nation that I'm most interested in building is our own.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2762,"2762_39","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","Now, let me be clear: None of this will be easy. The struggle against violent extremism will not be finished quickly, and it extends well beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan. It will be an enduring test of our free society and our leadership in the world. And unlike the great power conflicts and clear lines of division that defined the 20th century, our effort will involve disorderly regions, failed states, diffuse enemies.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2762,"2762_40","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","So as a result, America will have to show our strength in the way that we end wars and prevent conflict, not just how we wage wars. We'll have to be nimble and precise in our use of military power.

And that's why I've made it a central pillar of my foreign policy to secure loose nuclear materials from terrorists, to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and to pursue the goal of a world without them, because every nation must understand that true security will never come from an endless race for evermore destructive weapons; true security will come for those who reject them.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2762,"2762_43","Remarks at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York","Barack Obama","December 01, 2009","Spoken Addresses and Remarks, Oral Address, Presidential","We'll have to use diplomacy, because no one nation can meet the challenges of an interconnected world acting alone.

And we must make it clear to every man, woman, and child around the world who lives under the dark cloud of tyranny that America will speak out on behalf of their human rights and tend to the light of freedom and justice and opportunity and respect for the dignity of all peoples.

And that's not unique to Spain; that's true throughout Europe. And frankly, that's true here in the United States and around the world. And so we pledge to continue to cooperate closely to promote strategies for growth and job creation. One of those strategies is to put together a transatlantic trade agreement. We both agreed that there is enormous potential for increasing trade and growth between two of the largest economic actors in the world, but it will require intensive work and serious compromise on all sides, and the Prime Minister and I agreed that it's well worth the effort.",0,"-","-","-","-"

First of all, the economy—the euro zone economy and the Spanish economy—I talked to the President about the fact that a little more than a year ago, we used to talk on the phone about the situation. Back then, there were doubts on the existence of the euro. It was difficult for countries in the euro zone to fund themselves because—for some countries—because the risk premium was very high. There was talk about some countries needing to be bailed out, among them Spain. Growth was low, unemployment was high, and there were competitiveness problems.",0,"-","-","-","-"

During the fourth quarter, the economy improved by 0.3 percent. And unemployment, however, remains the main problem. But the latest figures both on unemployment and on social security enrollment are very encouraging. Next year, Spain will grow, and jobs will be created, but we will still have to work with determination, perseverance, and courage. And I'm sure that the vast majority of Spaniards understand that this effort was necessary and it will have an impact on the future.",0,"-","-","-","-"

Both our territories make up 50 percent of GDP. It's probably the freest, the largest trade area, and it can set trade rules for the future.

And I think that what's important is that we got the policy right, but that this is hard and it always has been. Whenever you've got men and women that you are sending into harm's way after having already made enormous investments in blood and treasure in another country, then part of your job as Commander in Chief is to sweat the details on it and to recognize that there is enormous sacrifices that are being made, and you're constantly asking yourselves questions about how you can improve the strategy.",0,"-","-","-","-"

Now, actually, that was two questions in one. For Spain, unemployment is still the most serious problem, as it is also for other European countries. And the goal of my policy over the last 2 years has been to lay the foundations to resolve the problem of unemployment. If we hadn't used the policy of fiscal consolidation and structural reform and we hadn't reformed our financial sector and brought our public accounts back to health, it would be—would have been impossible to create jobs.

Division doesn't help. Uncertainty doesn't help. But that's something that we all—we will overcome, because it will be very bad for everyone if something like that took place, especially for the smallest of the units.

Well, I think Mariano captured the challenges that we've all faced in the wake of the original crisis back in 2007, 2008. The first step is to stabilize the economy, and that means making sure that the banking sectors, the financial systems, are stable. And different countries were in different positions. For Spain, that was a greater challenge to settle down the markets, to make sure that they had access to those markets. And so the steps that had been taken for structural reform and fiscal consolidation were necessary predicates for growth.",0,"-","-","-","-"
2917,"2917_40","Remarks Following a Meeting With Prime Minster Mariano Rajoy Brey of Spain and an Exchange With Reporters","Barack Obama","January 13, 2014","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","And by the way, those are never the most politically popular steps to take, but they're often necessary.

2917,"2917_41","Remarks Following a Meeting With Prime Minster Mariano Rajoy Brey of Spain and an Exchange With Reporters","Barack Obama","January 13, 2014","Miscellaneous, Miscellaneous Remarks, Presidential","And my view is, is that Europe as a whole has the ability to grow faster. For countries that are still engaged in necessary fiscal consolidation, they may not be able to drive demand in Europe, but there are also surplus countries that can be doing more to increase demand the continent as a whole. And when you combine those with the structural reforms that are taking place, as well as potential trade agreements that can expand markets for businesses, small and large, on either side of the Atlantic, then you have a potential recipe for increased growth and a virtuous cycle that can lead ultimately to greater prosperity, lower unemployment, higher wages. And I think that's the objective of any government's economic policies, is how does it translate into improved living standards and improved opportunities for ordinary people? I know that that's the goal of the President of Spain, and that's my goal as President of the United States, and hopefully, we can work together to accomplish that.",0,"-","-","-","-"

And the best way to do that is to bring allies aboard. That means—that includes, by the way, police departments that are doing the right thing, like Dallas, which has implemented the very reforms that Black Lives Matter is seeking.

Well, I think Prime Minister Rajoy is absolutely right that although it matters a great deal to us that we have a stable, well-functioning Spanish Government, the nature of the relationship, the bond between the United States and Spain is not dependent on which party is in power, in the same way that my expectation would be that, although there might be differences in foreign policy if I had a successor that was Republican rather than Democrat, there would still be a core interest as fellow NATO members who are concerned about terrorism and are concerned about a wide range of international and security and economic issues.",1,"-","-","-","-"

And although our political process is messy and dominated by too much money, and it lasts too long, and there's a lot of rhetoric that is all over the place, at the end of the day, I think people recognize the importance of the office of the President and that the United States occupies a unique role in the world and will take that decision about who sits in the Oval Office very seriously.",0,"-","-","-","-"
